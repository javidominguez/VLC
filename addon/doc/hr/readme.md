Ovaj dodatak dodaje nekoliko poboljšanja pristupačnosti u VLC Media Playeru.

1. Allows navigating through the playback controls using Tab and
   Shift+Tab. To activate a selected control press enter.
2. Reads status bar information (press I). The gesture can be set up in NVDA
   preferences.
3. Says elapsed time when moving back and forward using VLC keystrokes:
   Control plus left/right arrow to skip 1 minute and Shift plus left/right
   arrows to skip 5 seconds. You can set the verbosity in the NVDA
   preferences. You can also assign a keyboard shortcut to toggle it.
4. Announces state when change random mode (key R) and repeat mode (key L).

* Important note: This addon is optimized for versions of VLC 3.0 and
  higher; it will not work correctly with earlier versions. To use VLC 2.x
  [download the old version of the addon.][1]
